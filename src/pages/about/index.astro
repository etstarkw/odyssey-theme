      title: 'How should readers approach the text and images?',
      content: 'The graphic novel has three streams: the spoken words of A and other characters, the illustrations, and the endnotes. Readers can engage with the endnotes for deeper insights at their own pace, either as they read or afterward to catch references and explore themes.'
  }, {
      title: 'What do you hope readers take away from this?',
      content: 'A foundation for their beliefs, a willingness to engage with difficult questions, and an understanding of faith as a living, evolving conversation. The goal is to inspire readers to think, reflect, and actively seek how best to live in the present.'
