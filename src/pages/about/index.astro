      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <p><strong>John Starkweather, Writer:</strong> John has been a retired (not in the sense of this story) engineer for the past ten years. He first had the idea for this story about a dozen years ago. His script for the play and now graphic novel has been evolving for about nine years. John is currently seeking a living kidney donor. You can learn more about his search by visiting and following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61566384599431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Join with John</a> on Facebook. While it is a coincidence that The Morning After Retirement is getting shared at the same time as John’s search for a kidney, both illustrate the need for love while facing life and mortality with hope.</p>

     <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <Accordion items={[{
      title: 'What kind of story is this?',
      content: 'It’s a surrealistic, Midrash-inspired retelling of biblical themes, blending scripture, personal reflection, and contemporary references. It’s not satire, though there’s humor. It’s not doctrine, though it wrestles with faith. At its heart, it’s a story about growth—both at the personal level and for humanity as a whole.'
  }, {
      title: 'How did The Morning After Retirement become a graphic novel?',
      content: 'The Morning After Retirement started as a short story and grew into the script for a three-act musical. When it came time to share the story more broadly, different formats were considered—a stage production, a podcast, and a graphic novel. In the end, the graphic novel proved to be the perfect fit. It allowed for rich visual storytelling that brings cultural references to life, enhances symbolism, and makes larger-than-life moments—like a helicopter rescue—feasible. The colors and artistic style reflect the story’s big themes, blending religious iconography, surrealism, and classic comic influences to create an experience that feels both theatrical and deeply symbolic.'
  }, {
      title: 'Who is the intended audience?',
      content: 'This book will be most appropriate for adults and young adults who are exploring their faith and curious about some of the big questions of life. It may look like a comic book, but it’s not intended for young children.'
  }, {
      title: 'Why is it called The Morning After Retirement?',
      content: 'The title reflects the perspective of Old A, the storyteller. He’s looking back on his life, reassessing choices, and seeing patterns he didn’t recognize before. Retirement often marks a turning point—one where people step back from active work and reflect on what they’ve built, what they’ve learned, and what still remains unresolved. In this story, retirement represents a passage from life on Earth to the afterlife, which gives Old A the chance to reflect back on the lessons of life as a whole.'
  }, {
      title: 'Why do the characters have single-letter names?',
      content: 'A, E, G, J, S, and D are shorthand for familiar biblical figures—Adam, Eve, God, Jesus, Spirit, Devil—but they’re also meant to be something more. A and E, for example, aren’t just Adam and Eve, but any man and every woman. The goal is to let the story introduce them on its own terms, so the reader isn’t locked into traditional interpretations.'
  }, {
      title: 'What’s the deal with the pits?',
      content: 'Pits represent “People In Trouble.” The Bible is full of pits—sometimes literal, sometimes metaphorical. This story uses them to symbolize different kinds of struggle, from personal crises to systemic injustice. If you’ve ever felt stuck in a pit of your own, you’ll probably see yourself somewhere in these pages.'
  }, {
      title: 'Why are there contemporary references in a biblical story?',
      content: 'Because these stories aren’t just ancient history. The themes of scripture—struggle, doubt, faith, love, and loss—keep resurfacing in every generation. By incorporating elements from modern culture, the book reinforces the idea that we’re still part of the same ongoing story.'
  }, {
      title: 'Why is there rhyme in some parts but not others?',
      content: 'Rhyme appears selectively throughout the story, not as a strict rule but as a tool. Some lines are written with poetic rhythm and rhyme to emphasize key moments, make certain ideas more memorable, or evoke the feel of oral storytelling traditions. It’s also a nod to works like Dante’s Divine Comedy, where poetic form helps elevate the themes. Italicized font is used to signal these moments, inviting the reader to notice when language takes on a more lyrical quality. Along with the vivid illustrations, the poetic language is used as part of the surreal approach to looking behind the masks people usually wear.'
  }, {
      title: 'What are the endnotes for?',
      content: 'As you read, you might notice layers of meaning woven into the dialogue and imagery. If you ever find yourself wondering about a biblical or cultural reference or want more context on a theme, the endnotes are there to help. They offer deeper insight into the references and ideas that shape the story. Feel free to explore them whenever curiosity strikes!'
  }, {
      title: 'What’s the goal of The Morning After Retirement? ',
      content: 'The goal is to engage with big questions about life, meaning, and morality, encouraging you to wrestle with the complexities of truth, justice, and love. It’s not about presenting a "right" way to believe or "fixing" any faith, but about offering an invitation to think deeply, question, and explore, whether you come from a religious background or not.'
  }, {
      title: 'How can I support The Morning After Retirement?',
      content: 'This is a passion project, so the goal is not to make money. The graphic novel is available for free digitally, and the printed version is sold at cost for printing and shipping. The best way to support this project is to share it! Tell your friends and family or suggest it as a study topic for a Bible class or group at your church. However you choose to share, it’ll be so appreciated!'
